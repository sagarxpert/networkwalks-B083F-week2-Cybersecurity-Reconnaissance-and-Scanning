# 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the work completed during **Week 02** of the **NetworkWalks Cybersecurity Internship (Batch B082)**.

The assessment focused on two primary cybersecurity activities:

- Passive & Active Footprinting
- Network Discovery & Enumeration using Zenmap

The objective was to collect publicly available information about an authorized target, analyze DNS and web technologies, identify reachable hosts within an authorized network, and document findings professionally.

---

# 📜 Authorization & Scope

This assessment was conducted under the authorization provided by **NetworkWalks**.

# Task 1 Objectives :

As part of **Week 02** of the **NetworkWalks Cybersecurity Internship (Batch B082)**, I performed authorized footprinting and reconnaissance activities against the approved target domain:

```text
networkwalks.com
```

The purpose of this exercise was to understand how publicly available information can be collected using different reconnaissance tools and how each tool provides a different perspective on a target's infrastructure.

The activities focused on:

- Domain intelligence gathering
- DNS enumeration
- Website technology identification
- Web Application Firewall detection
- HTTP response analysis
- Documentation and reporting

---

# 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand footprinting and reconnaissance concepts
- Gather information from publicly available sources
- Perform DNS enumeration
- Identify website technologies
- Detect Web Application Firewall protections
- Analyze HTTP response headers
- Document findings professionally
- Practice ethical reconnaissance methodologies

# 🌐 Module 5 — Network Scanning with Zenmap (W2-PM5)

## Objective

Identify active hosts, enumerate network information, and visualize network topology using Zenmap.

---

## 1️⃣ Network Configuration & Scope

### Objective

Identify the local IP address and LAN subnet before performing network discovery. This establishes the scanning range for the authorized assessment.

### Command

```cmd
ipconfig
```

---

## 2️⃣ Live Host Discovery

### Objective

Identify active hosts within the authorized LAN subnet using Zenmap's Ping Scan.

### Scan Configuration

- **Target:** Local LAN subnet identified in Task 1
- **Profile:** Ping Scan
- **Nmap Scan:** Host Discovery

### Command

```bash
nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24
```

### Evidence

<img width="1919" height="1005" alt="Screenshot 2026-08-20 091413" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2b43df3-ab61-4bdd-89d5-2a8504e8fea3" />


---

## 3️⃣ Live Host Count

### Objective

Determine the total number of active hosts identified during the Zenmap host-discovery scan.

### Result

The scan identified **4 live hosts**, including the assessment system.

### Evidence

---

## 4️⃣ Live Host IP Addresses

### Objective

Record the IPv4 addresses of the hosts identified as active during the Zenmap discovery scan.

### Results

The following hosts were identified as live:

| Host | IP Address |
|------|------------|
| Host 1 | `10.0.0.0/24` |
| Host 2 | `10.0.0.0/25` |
| Host 3 | `10.0.0.0/26` |
| Host 4 | `10.0.0.0/27` |
---

## 5️⃣ Live Host MAC Addresses

### Objective

Record the MAC addresses associated with the live hosts identified during the Zenmap discovery scan.

### Results

| Host | MAC Address |
|------|-------------|
| Host 1 | `00:50:56:C0:00:02` |
| Host 2 | `00:50:56:C0:00:02` |
| Host 3 | `00:50:56:C0:00:02` |
| Host 4 | `00:50:56:C0:00:02` |

The fourth MAC address represents the local assessment system and was obtained using the system's network configuration.

---

## 6️⃣ Network Topology Mapping

### Objective

Visualize the discovered hosts and network relationships using Zenmap's **Topology** view and preserve the result as supporting assessment evidence.

### Procedure

1. Open the **Topology** tab in Zenmap.
2. Enable the topology legend.
3. Review the displayed network relationships.
4. Save the topology graphic.
5. Select **PDF** as the output format.
6. Store the exported topology with the assessment evidence.

### Evidence

| IP Addresses Recorded | **4** |
| MAC Addresses Recorded | **4** |
| Network Topology | Generated and Exported to PDF |
| Scanning Tool | Zenmap / Nmap |
| Assessment Scope | Authorized Local LAN |

---

### Key Takeaway

The Zenmap assessment successfully identified the active hosts within the authorized LAN and documented their IP and MAC addresses. The resulting topology diagram provides a visual representation of the discovered network and has been preserved as supporting evidence.

# 📋 Module 3 — Final Assessment Report (W2-PM-FINAL)

## Executive Summary

This assessment was conducted as part of the NetworkWalks Cybersecurity Internship (Batch B082) and focused on authorized reconnaissance and network discovery activities.

The objective was to gather publicly available information about the target environment, analyze DNS and web technologies, identify reachable hosts within the authorized network, and document findings using industry-standard reconnaissance and network-scanning methodologies.

The assessment combined both passive and active information-gathering techniques through footprinting tools and Zenmap-based network discovery.

---

## Assessment Methodology

The assessment followed a structured three-phase approach:

### Phase 1 — Reconnaissance

Information gathering was conducted using:

- WHOIS
- NSLOOKUP
- DNSRecon
- WhatWeb
- Wafw00f
- cURL

These tools were used to collect publicly available information regarding domain registration, DNS records, web technologies, security controls, and HTTP response characteristics.

---

### Phase 2 — Network Discovery

Network scanning activities were conducted using Zenmap and Nmap.

The assessment included:

- Network configuration verification
- Host discovery
- Live host identification
- IP address enumeration
- MAC address collection
- Network topology generation

---

### Phase 3 — Reporting & Documentation

Assessment evidence was collected, organized, and documented throughout the engagement.

The final report was prepared to provide:

- Assessment objectives
- Methodology
- Findings
- Supporting evidence
- Summary observations

---

## Reconnaissance Findings Summary

The footprinting phase successfully collected information related to:

| Area | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| WHOIS | Domain registration information |
| DNS Resolution | Domain-to-IP resolution |
| DNS Enumeration | DNS record discovery |
| Technology Fingerprinting | Web technologies in use |
| WAF Detection | Presence of web application protection |
| HTTP Analysis | Response headers and server information |

The collected information provided insight into the target's publicly accessible infrastructure and technology stack.

---

## Network Discovery Findings Summary

The Zenmap assessment successfully identified active hosts within the authorized assessment network.

### Results

| Assessment Item | Result |
|-----------------|---------|
| Live Hosts Identified | 4 |
| IP Addresses Recorded | 4 |
| MAC Addresses Recorded | 4 |
| Network Topology Generated | Yes |
| Topology Exported | PDF |

### Network Information Collected

| Host   | IP Address |
|--------|-------------|
| Host 1 | 10.0.0.0/24 |
| Host 2 | 10.0.0.0/25 |
| Host 3 | 10.0.0.0/26 |
| Host 4 | 10.0.0.0/27 |

The resulting topology diagram provided a visual representation of the discovered network environment.

---

## Cross-Phase Analysis

The assessment combined both reconnaissance and network-discovery activities to provide multiple perspectives of the authorized environment.

### External Perspective

The footprinting phase provided visibility into:

- Domain ownership information
- DNS infrastructure
- Web technologies
- Security controls
- HTTP response behavior

### Internal Perspective

The network-scanning phase provided visibility into:

- Reachable hosts
- Network addressing
- MAC address information
- Network topology

Together, these activities established a baseline understanding of the assessed environment.

## Assessment Conclusion

The Week 02 assessment successfully achieved its objectives by combining authorized footprinting and network discovery activities.

Reconnaissance techniques provided valuable information regarding domain registration, DNS infrastructure, web technologies, security controls, and HTTP response characteristics. Network scanning activities successfully identified active hosts, recorded network information, and generated a visual topology of the authorized environment.

The assessment demonstrates the practical application of information-gathering and network-discovery methodologies while maintaining compliance with the authorized scope defined by NetworkWalks.

The collected evidence and documented findings provide a structured baseline that can support future security assessments, network analysis activities, and cybersecurity learning objectives.
